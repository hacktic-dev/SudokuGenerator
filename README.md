# Sudoku Generator
 
This program will generate random sudoku puzzles. When generating the puzzle from the solution grid it uses a hybrid method to ensure a unique solution at each step for greater speed. I intend to expand this hybrid method to also use a heuristic during the sequential backtracking.
